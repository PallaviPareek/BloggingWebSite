          <h2 class="section-heading">Why JavaScript?</h2>
          <p>Javascript is the scripting language of the internet and one of the most essential web technologies along with HTML and CSS. It’s a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. In more simplistic terms, it’s what allows you to implement and display complex things on your webpage, to create content, to animate images and tons of other amazing possibilities with just a few lines of code.</p>
          <p>There’re plenty of reasons to learn this wonderful programming language. The most important one is the fact that JavaScript runs everything and everywhere. Most of the prominent websites are built on the backbone of JavaScript while currently there are more than 3 billion devices be it Smartphones or desktops. JavaScript went through a massive surge of popularity and quickly become the most dominant language in the world of software. In light of this, it’s obvious that Javascript skills are in high demand by companies everywhere. Currently, the average salary for JavaScript developer is $95,981 in the US. For all these reasons and more, it’s lucrative to have JavaScript skills on your resume.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Tips for JavaScript Beginner</h2>

          <p>So the question is how to learn JavaScript? Similar to every complicated thing in life, you can learn JavaScript coding through constant practice and by never giving up. To help you in this task, we have written down the best way of learning this skill just for you! Try to follow these tips to enhance your learning experience.</p>
          
          <h3 class="section-heading">1. Right attitude</h3>
          <p>The first thing you need to do is to go with the right attitude to learn JavaScript. Learning JavaScript is going to become needlessly more bothersome if you approach it with the wrong mindset. Trying to learn it with an “I need to get this over” mindset is not going to take you anywhere. It’s a huge struggle to face and you truly have to be passionate about code to learn it. Not only that, you need to remind yourself to have fun with what you’re learning as JavaScript code is capable of astonishing things once you get the hang of it.</p>
          
          <h3 class="section-heading">2. Start Slowly</h3>  
          <p>A mistake many beginners make is that they directly start working on frameworks such as jQuery, AngularJS, Backbone, etc. You should never do it. Instead, you should start working on DataTypes and in-built methods. You can also learn a lot from the Mozilla Developer Network, which is a great place for you to start. After getting enough of the fundamentals, you can try NodeJS. Trust me, NodeJS is very simple, just a JavaScript code backed up with inbuilt libraries. Then, you can try frameworks.</p>
          <h3 class="section-heading">3. Find the perfect editor for JavaScript</h3>
            
          <p> You can’t code without a text editor. Fortunately, you have tons of options to choose from. To write JavaScript code, you can either use your Windows notepad or even download programs such as Notepad++ or Visual Studio Code. Either way, after going through all possible editors, choose the one that you’re most comfortable to work on as this is where you’ll be spending most of your time. Also when you’re starting out, it’s essential to choose an editor that has a simplistic interface and will support you as a beginner.
          </p>  
          <h3 class="section-heading">4. JavaScript Tutorials!</h3>  
          <p> If you search the web for JavaScript tutorials, there are a vast number of tutorials available online on sites such as CodeAcademy, FreeCodeCamp, etc. If you’re a beginner then you should start from beginner level JavaScript tutorials and then move on to intermediate and advanced level. Tutorials are like doing grammar exercises and the sites with JavaScript tutorials are ideal for learning the basics and getting used to the syntax. Learning JavaScript is no different than learning French or Spanish. It takes time.
          </p>
          <h3 class="section-heading">5. Look out for JavaScript Resources</h3>
             The internet has millions of sources available for you to use. Take “JavaScript: The Definitive Guide” by David Flanagan. It’s a book that has been forever considered a bible for JavaScript programmers across the world. In it is a comprehensive guide that is well-organized and detailed for new programmers to learn and old programmers to revise. Another book that you can read is “You Don’t Know JS: Up and Going” by Kyle Simpson which provides the necessary background for those with limited knowledge about programming. The entire series introduces more complex and harder parts of the JavaScript language as you read on one book at a time. Furthermore, there are tons of articles, blog posts and even YouTube videos available for reference. Don’t waste these valuable resources!</p>
